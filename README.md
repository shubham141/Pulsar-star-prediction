# Pulsar-star-prediction
Neural Networks algorithm is used to predict Pulsar stars with high accuracy of 98%. The Kaggle Pulsar Data Set was used to train and test models to predict Pulsars. To find the best algorithm for the dataset, I examine eight algorithms based on four features. In addition, I evaluate algorithms using ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, and Confusion Matrixes.
